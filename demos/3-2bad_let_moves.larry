    Demo 6: ERROR Moves within a Let
        - ERROR you cannot use a value after move
        - Using a value in 2 places would require a copy
            or multiple pointers to the same value
            which is unsafe

(let ((x (box 5)))  ; Allocates a box in the store
    (let ((y x))    ; The value stored at x is moved into y
        (unbox x))) ; Getting value out of x, ERROR: x has been moved
