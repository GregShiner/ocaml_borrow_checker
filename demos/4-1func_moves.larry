    Demo 7: Moves with function calls
        - Values are moved when they are passed as arguments to functions
        - This is because the function takes ownership of the value
|#

(let ((x (box 5)))                          ; Allocates a box in the store
    (let ((f (lambda (y) (+ 1 (unbox y))))) ; Function unboxes param and adds 1 to it
        (f x)))                             ; We move x into f, f takes ownership of x
